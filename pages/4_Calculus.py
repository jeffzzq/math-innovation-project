                For 200 years after Newton and Leibniz, Calculus relied on **Infinitesimals**—mysterious numbers that were "infinitely small but not zero." Philosophers like Bishop Berkeley famously mocked them as the *"ghosts of departed quantities."*

                ### 📖 The History: A Mathematical Heist?
                This famous rule is named after the Marquis de L'Hôpital, who published it in 1696. However, it was actually discovered by the brilliant mathematician **Johann Bernoulli**. L'Hôpital, a wealthy nobleman, essentially paid Bernoulli a salary in exchange for the rights to claim Bernoulli's mathematical discoveries as his own!

                ### 🎯 Why do we need it?
                Algebraic tricks (like factoring) only work on polynomials. When we face transcendental functions like $\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\sin(x)}{x}$, algebra fails completely. **You cannot "factor" a sine wave.** We need a universal tool.

                ### 🧠 The Intuition: "A Race to Zero"
                Imagine the numerator $f(x)$ and denominator $g(x)$ as two runners. At $x=0$, they both hit the exact same position ($0/0$). 
                If they both start at $0$, the ratio of their positions near the origin is simply the ratio of **how fast they are running**. 

                Mathematically, if we zoom in infinitely close, curves become straight lines (**Local Linearization**). We stop dividing their *heights* and start dividing their *slopes* (derivatives):

                    **"If a curve is continuous (unbroken), it must eventually look smooth if you zoom in enough."** Think about a circle or a wave. If you zoom in on the edge, it looks like a flat, straight line. If it looks like a straight line, you can balance a tangent line on it, which means we can find its **Slope (Derivative)**. 

                    Sure, a function like $y = |x|$ has *one* sharp corner where a tangent line fails. But surely, a continuous line can't be made of *only* corners, right?

                    st.markdown("""
                        You might be wondering: How can a dimension be a decimal? And more importantly, **where does the Limit come in?**

                        To understand this, we must redefine how we calculate dimensions using the concept of **Scaling**. Let's see what happens when we scale an object up by a factor of $S$ (let's say, scale by 3):

                        * **1D (Line):** Scale its length by 3, and you get exactly **3** copies of the original line. ($3 = 3^1$)
                        * **2D (Square):** Scale its sides by 3, and you get exactly **9** copies of the original square. ($9 = 3^2$)
                        * **3D (Cube):** Scale its edges by 3, and you get exactly **27** copies of the original cube. ($27 = 3^3$)

                        Notice the pattern? $\\text{Number of Copies} = \\text{Scale}^{\\text{Dimension}}$. 
                        Using logarithms, we can flip this to solve for the Dimension ($D$):
                        $$D = \\frac{\\log(\\text{Copies})}{\\log(\\text{Scale})}$$

                        #### The Koch Snowflake Dimension
                        Now apply this to the Koch Snowflake. Every time you zoom in (scale) by a factor of **3**, the fractal doesn't give you 3 copies—it produces exactly **4** segments. Plug this into our formula:
                        $$D = \\frac{\\log(4)}{\\log(3)} \\approx 1.2618$$
                        It is strictly greater than 1, but less than 2!

                        #### The Ultimate Limit: Box-Counting Dimension
                        For wild, real-world fractals like coastlines, we can't just count perfectly symmetrical copies. Instead, mathematicians place a grid of tiny boxes (with side length $\\epsilon$) over the shape and count how many boxes ($N$) contain a piece of the curve.

                        To find the *exact*, true dimension, we cannot use finite boxes. We must shrink the boxes until they are infinitely small. This requires our ultimate mathematical tool—**The Limit**:

                        $$D = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\frac{\\log(N(\\epsilon))}{\\log(1/\\epsilon)}$$

                        **Conclusion:** Limits are not just for finding points on a graph. They are the only mathematical tool powerful enough to define the fundamental geometry of nature itself.

                        🌉 **The Final Bridge to Chapter II**

                        We have successfully used **Limits** to define **Continuity**. Continuity guarantees that a function has a connected **Position** without any gaps. 

                        But Fractals reveal a critical limitation: **Position $\\neq$ Direction.** A curve can be perfectly continuous, yet have no defined slope at any point.

                        In physics and engineering, knowing *where* a particle is located is useless if we cannot calculate *how fast* it is changing. To study motion, we must filter out these jagged functions and study curves that are strictly **'Smooth'**.

                        How do we mathematically measure 'Smoothness'? We don't need new math—we just need to apply our ultimate tool, the **Limit**, to a completely new object: **The Rate of Change**.

                What about the inverse of $e^x$? The natural logarithm $y = \ln(x)$.

                We don't need complex limits here. We just need **Geometry**.
                Geometrically, an inverse function is just a reflection across the diagonal line $y = x$. This reflection simply **swaps the X and Y axes**.

                **Think about it like climbing stairs:**
                1. Imagine you are on the $e^x$ curve at point $(a, e^a)$. 
                2. Suppose the slope here is **2**. This means for every **1 step Right (X)**, you go **2 steps Up (Y)**.
                3. Now, reflect this across $y=x$. The X and Y directions swap!
                4. Your new instructions are: for every **1 step Up (New Y)**, you go **2 steps Right (New X)**.
                5. What is the slope of this new line? Rise over Run = **$1/2$**.

                **Conclusion:** When you reflect a curve, its slope perfectly flips to its reciprocal (倒数).
                * If the slope of $e^x$ at point $(a, b)$ is **$b$**.
                * The slope of $\ln(x)$ at the reflected point $(b, a)$ must be **$1/b$**.

                Let's drop the abstract triangles and look at this like a video game. 

                Imagine you are driving a car counter-clockwise on a circular track (Radius = 1) at a constant speed of 1 radian per second.
                At any time $t$:
                * **Your Horizontal Position (X)** is $\\cos(t)$
                * **Your Vertical Position (Y)** is $\\sin(t)$

                Because the car's speed is 1, its **Velocity (Derivative)** is literally just the direction the headlights are pointing!

                **Let's test two specific moments:**
                1. **At $t=0$ (The far right edge):** You are at coordinate $(1, 0)$. Your car is pointing **straight UP**.
                   This means your vertical speed (Y-derivative) is **1**, and your horizontal speed (X-derivative) is **0**.
                   Check the math: $\\frac{d}{dt}\\sin(0) = \\cos(0) = 1$. It matches!

                2. **At $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ (The very top):** You are at coordinate $(0, 1)$. Your car is pointing **straight LEFT**.
                   This means your horizontal speed (X-derivative) is **-1** (because left is negative), and your vertical speed is **0**.
                   Check the math: $\\frac{d}{dt}\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -1$. It matches perfectly!

                Since the velocity arrow (headlights) is always perfectly tangent to the circle, it is always rotated exactly 90° from your position. 
                This 90° rotation is geometrically identical to swapping X and Y, and making X negative.
